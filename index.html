            To my incredible Mum, on your special day, I want to take a moment to celebrate the woman who has been my first teacher, my biggest cheerleader, and my safest home. Thank you for the endless sacrifices you’ve made and the unconditional love you’ve poured into our family; you are the heartbeat that keeps us all together. Whether you’re offering your quiet strength in hard times or making everyone laugh with your "vintage" jokes, your grace and wisdom inspire me every single day. I am so lucky and blessed to be your child, and my greatest wish is to grow up to be even half the person you are. Happy Birthday to the queen of our hearts—you deserve all the joy and love in the world.
        </p>
